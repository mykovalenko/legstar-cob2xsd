= COBOL Structure Abstract Syntax Tree =

The first step in converting a COBOL structure to an XML Schema is to parse the COBOL structure code into an Abstract Syntax Tree.

In legstar-cob2xsd, this is achieved using [http://www.antlr.org/ ANTLR]. TYou can find the grammars [http://code.google.com/p/legstar-cob2xsd/source/browse/#svn/trunk/src/main/antlr3/com/legstar/cobol here].

Most of the parsing code is automatically generated by ANTLR.

The following graph shows all the attributes that are recognized by the parser and how they relate to each other:
