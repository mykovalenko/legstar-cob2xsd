= Overview =

The legstar-cob2xsd utility is distributed as an API, an Apache ANT Task and a standalone executable jar.

There are mainly 2 packages:

|| com.legstar.cobol || Contains the parsing logic ||
|| com.legstar.cob2xsd || Contains the XML Schema generation ||

== Parser implementation ==

Parsing is achieved using the [http://www.antlr.org/ ANLR] lexer/parser. The ANTLR grammars are [http://code.google.com/p/legstar-cob2xsd/source/browse/#svn/trunk/src/main/antlr3/com/legstar/cobol here].

This is a summary of the parsing process implementation in legstar-cob2xsd:

The COBOL model is a set of java classes in package [http://www.legsem.com/legstar/legstar-cob2xsd/apidocs/com/legstar/cobol/model/package-summary.html com.legstar.cobol.model].

== XML Schema generation implementation ==

This is done in a single step:

There is a set of helper classes:

|| [http://www.legsem.com/legstar/legstar-cob2xsd/apidocs/com/legstar/cob2xsd/XsdDataItem.html XsdDataItem] || Maps a COBOL data item from the model to the XML Schema counterpart ||
|| [http://www.legsem.com/legstar/legstar-cob2xsd/apidocs/com/legstar/cob2xsd/XsdAnnotationEmitter.html XsdAnnotationEmitter] || Used when LegStar annotations are to be added to the XML Schema ||
